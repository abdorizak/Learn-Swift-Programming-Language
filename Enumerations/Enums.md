## Enumerations

An enumeration defines a common type for a group of related values and enables you to work with those values in a type-safe way within your code.
`Enumerations` in Swift are first-class types in their own right. They adopt many features traditionally supported only by classes, such as computed properties to provide additional information about the enumerationâ€™s current value, and instance methods to provide functionality related to the values the enumeration represents. Enumerations can also define initializers to provide an initial case value; can be extended to expand their functionality beyond their original implementation; and can conform to protocols to provide standard functionality.

Enumeration Syntax

```
enum SomeEnumeration {
    // enumeration definition goes here
}
```

another Example of enumeration:

```
enum Weather {
    case Rainy
    case Hot
    case Sunny
    case Winter
}

func weatherType(_ typeWether: Weather) {
    switch typeWether {
    case .Rainy:
        print("Today is Rainny")
    case .Hot:
        print("Today is HotDay")
    case .Sunny:
        print("Today is Sunny")
    case .Winter:
        print("Today is Winter")
    }
}

weatherType(.Winter)
```
